# Binary Search Tree

Using classes, we can create a binary search tree, insert new nodes, test if it balanced, make it balanced (if it is not) and print its elements in level, pre, post, and in order.

We also have methods that allow us to find a node of a given value `find(value)` or to get its depth or hight.
